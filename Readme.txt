My last Hackintosh setup:

hardware:
Intel i5-8600
Gigabyte Z370M D3H (rev. 1.0) Bios updated to F14
16GB DDR4 2666MHZ
Gigabyte RX 580 8GB Gaming
SSDs Silicon Power 480GB & Crucial 500GB SATA Drives
Some cpu cooler, case, a bunch of USB3 hubs etc., external TP-LINK router used as a wifi card...

Will upload my OpenCore based EFI folder with kexts and drivers, fully working with iMessage, FaceTime and Hardware Acceleration on Monterey.
